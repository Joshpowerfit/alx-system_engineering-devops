when was the issue detected
After working on a project, I checked but it wasn't checking and it was not checking 

how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complainedâ€¦)
My task refused to check 

actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue) 
I checked all over the code again and again

misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
how the incident was resolved

I consulted senior colleage and we were able to sort it by going through the writting code
